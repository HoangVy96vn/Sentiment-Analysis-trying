(take file named "Review")

This code was followed Rob tutorial "Python Sentiment Analysis Project with NLTK and ðŸ¤— Transformers. Classify Amazon Reviews!!" in youtube

there is a part of code struggling with pytorch, and I couldn't try Roberta model because of lacking of pytorch environments. 
But it works well with built model of "sentiment analysis" from transformers. And the result was good.
